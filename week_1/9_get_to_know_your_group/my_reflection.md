<!-- Hi Everyone!

My name is Alexis Ernst and I am from Franklin, MI. I currently attend the University of Michigan. I am super excited to be attending DBC this summer, and am even more excited to meet you guys! Some of my favorite things to do are swimming, hiking, biking, and water skiing. Where are you all from? What are you most excited about this summer? My biggest fear for this summer is falling behind and not reaching my potential. What about you guys? I look forward to hearing from you all!

Alexis :) -->

Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down. 

<!-- Other people's responses definitely made me feel a lot better about my fears. I found out that everyone else was nervous too aobut falling behind or not being able to keep up with the course material. I'm really excited to get to know everyone. Everyone seems very approachable and passionate about learning this summer! I truly think this will be an amazing, unforgettable experience. -->
