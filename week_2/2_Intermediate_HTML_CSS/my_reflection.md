# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I think web standards are difficult to fully understand, but I do feel that they are necessary to everything we do on the World Wide Web. They are good, because without them, I doubt there would be a good structure to work of of. The new HTML5 elements are interesting, but they do confuse me. I need to look further into the header element asd I am confused on what exactly needs to go there and why. I use safari, chrome, and firegox. Sites do look different based on the browser, but only slightly. The most conspiciously different site that I have seen across browswers is Google Maps.
