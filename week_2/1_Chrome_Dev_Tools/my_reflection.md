# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

The Document Object Model is an application programming interface for HTML documents. It helps guide the logical structure of documents and the way a document can be changed. It makes it easy to navigate a structure, add, or modify elements. It can be used in many different ways. I found Chrome Web Tools difficult to use, but once I got the hang of it I found it very helpful and relvebent. I did a lot of research on Chrome Dev Tools and the DOM to better understand these tools and their functionality.
