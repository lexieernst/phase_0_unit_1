Responsive web design is when design is based on the user's behavior and environment. The practice helps with user experience and makes the use of technology much easier and more enjoyable. Smartphons and tablets have changes bed design as now webpages are available on many other platforms besides jsut computers. This calls for many changes to web design, such as font size, accessibility, and layout of information. The more technology continutes to grow, we will see more and more changes in web design. Visually impaired people use the web soley from sounds, but I feel that in the future the web should cater to more of their needs, and even one day provide Braille options.
